To set up the PowerShell script to run on its own, you'll need to follow these steps:

Save the Script: Save the PowerShell script to a file with a .ps1 extension. For example, you could name it MonitorLogFile.ps1.

Configure Email Settings: Replace the placeholder values in the script with your actual email server settings ($smtpServer, $smtpFrom, and $smtpTo). Ensure that you have permission to send emails through the specified SMTP server.

Modify Log Folder Path: If your log files are stored in a different folder than D:\Test, modify the $logFolderPath variable to point to the correct folder.

Adjust Error Detection: If the log file format or error detection logic differs from the provided script (e.g., if errors are identified differently in your log files), modify the error extraction logic accordingly.

Run PowerShell as Administrator: Open PowerShell as an administrator. This is necessary for setting the execution policy and running the script.

Set Execution Policy: By default, PowerShell restricts running scripts. You may need to set the execution policy to allow script execution. You can do this by running the following command:

javascript
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Choose the appropriate execution policy based on your security requirements.

Run the Script: Navigate to the directory where the script is saved using PowerShell and run the script by entering its name preceded by .\. For example:

Copy code
.\MonitorLogFile.ps1
Leave the Script Running: Once the script is running, it will continuously monitor the specified folder for changes in log files and automatically send emails when errors are detected.

Considerations for Running Indefinitely: Keep in mind that the script, as provided, runs indefinitely. You may want to consider implementing additional mechanisms for error handling, logging, or terminating the script if needed.

Testing and Monitoring: Test the script thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected. Monitor the email notifications to verify that errors are being detected and emails are sent appropriately.
